# Hi, I’m Katharina 🪽

I’m a junior Cloud / DevOps Engineer with a background in Python backend, AWS, Terraform, Docker, CI/CD and observability (Prometheus / Grafana).

🦋 I recently completed a 60-week Software Engineering program (Masterschool) and an 8-week full-time Cloud/DevSecOps internship at Webeet.io, where I worked on:
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- AWS infrastructure (S3, Route 53, DNS)
- Local observability stack with Docker Compose (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Promtail)
- Squad collaboration and co-leading a small team

Before tech, I spent many years in music, art and care work, which still shapes how I work and how I see the world around me: sensitive, full of details, and very aware of interpersonal dynamics and communication. The more I immerse myself in tech, the more I crave nature and appreciate everything that is alive around me even more. 🐞 I plan to travel with my two cats in a van one day. 

🐌 Currently working on:
- Strengthening my troubleshooting & Linux skills  
- Building projects that combine music & cloud  
- Preparing for more Cloud / DevOps roles (junior level, remote / hybrid)

🫀 I care about clear communication, psychological safety in teams, and excellent workflows.
