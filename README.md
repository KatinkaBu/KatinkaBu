# Hi, I’m Katharina!

I’m a junior Cloud / DevOps Engineer with a background in Python backend, AWS, Terraform, Docker, CI/CD and observability (Prometheus / Grafana).

🦋 

I recently completed a 60-week Software Engineering program (Masterschool) and an 8-week full-time Cloud/DevSecOps internship at Webeet, where I worked on:
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- AWS infrastructure (S3, Route 53, DNS)
- Local observability stack with Docker Compose (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Promtail)
- Squad collaboration and co-leading a small team

🫀

Before tech, I spent many years in music, art and care work. My experiences still shape how I work and how I see the world around me: sensitive, full of details, and with a gift of awareness when it comes to interpersonal dynamics and communication. The more I immerse myself in tech, the more I crave nature and appreciate everything that is alive around me even more. I like to think about how the systems of nature interplay with other systems. To understand the technological side, I actively broaden my understanding of the technical and historical foundations of modern computing and infrastructure, with a strong interest in how technology and society are interwoven. I plan to travel with my two cats in a van one day and experience the beauty of the world even more intensely.

Currently working on:
- Building projects that combine music & cloud, Project "Cloud Music Diary" is in the making. 
- Preparing for more Cloud / DevOps roles (junior level, remote / hybrid / on site).
